====================

This folder contains extensions to *lest*. These extensions are not part of *lest* itself because for example they use non-standard behaviour, they  are considered to be for a too-specific use case, or they are considered not yet ripe for inclusion in *lest* and we first like to gain more experience with them.

Available extensions:
- [Expect abort assertions](lest_expect_abort/Readme.md) by Martin Moene.
This extension lets you assert assertions and other calls to `abort()`.
- [Expect assert assertions](lest_expect_assert/Readme.md) by Martin Moene.
This extension lets you assert assertions by replacing `assert()`.
